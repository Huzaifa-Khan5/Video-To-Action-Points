 Or it will be a partial, or it will be a partial delete of say, you know, everything else in terms of profile picture interest, all of that will be deleted, the chats will be deleted, everyone will be deleted, except for maybe they gender, they're age, they're username, nickname. Yeah, okay, so let me just confirm on that and then I will get back. But it's either one of these, either it's complete delete or partial delete. I'll solve delete. Okay, so, Mohammed, let me share my screen again. To finish up. Yes. So, did you see my screen? Yeah. So, we have covered right now on account deletion, you will get back to me, consent management. As a user, I want to provide explicit consent for data usage during account creation, so I control my privacy. What can you actually in this part consent management? That, that is on the awarding. And yeah, on last screen. Yeah, yeah. So, you know when you see, when you go to log in via phone or social, at the bottom says by clicking continue, you agree that is basically it. Yeah, okay, so account creation feedback, as a user, I want the immediate feedback user, and the availability during registration. So, I can adjust inputs, instant variation either whether the entity, data, DNA, and reducing the frustration during the all right. Okay, this thing is clear, this is simple validation. Okay, so the push notification. This is live validation, yeah. So, as I'm typing my user name, it should tell me whether this is available or not, immediately. So, the next feature is push notification. We don't have push notifications yet. All right, screen yet. Push notifications. Okay, we will be. This is US, the zero double one. In app notification, the FI receive, which I receive outside the app, and within that, and a broadcast notification that admin is sharing, this will be with notification, you know, notification section. The notification UI is not here. There, even I don't see the icon of notification in the UI. Okay, not a problem. Because it has the use case, right? So, let me down. All right, down. Well, notification notification. Okay, screen. Okay, so user engagement feedback service. So, feedback service, as a user, I want to participate in a quick survey or so that mine would have been through the app. Feedback, it's the one reviews that we were looking, if that the feedback, why it will be something different? You are talking about. Yes, I'm thinking one moment. Sorry. Okay, it will be something else. It will be something else. So, I'll add this to this of add screens or feedback services. Feedback service. Okay, so random video chats, we have covered, okay. It's a manager, gender and location. It's our escape user. So, escape user, there is no such, you know, representation in the UI right here, right now. If you see on the video chat part, we don't have an option to skip here. Yeah, but it's just swiping. Yeah, it's just swiping. Okay. Yeah, it's left and right. That's how you skip or you return back to the home screen. It's swipe right to skip, swipe left to return to home screen. This is the only way. Sorry. Start left to back. Right to skip. Okay. So, reporting appropriate behavior that's clear and gives its clear skip timer to what this skip timer is. As a user, I can only skip the next random user after five seconds. If not, it's subscribe as a skip instant. Okay, if not subscribe. As what is the meaning? If not subscribe. Yeah, you can ignore that if not subscribe. But it's basically the timer of five seconds, right? So, if within those five seconds, they're not able to skip. That's a skip timer basically. Okay, for sure. Time display is here. It starts to exit. There's real time messaging here. In appropriate message, messages, we don't have this. Okay. Good to answer you. We don't have anything on the messages screen for in appropriate messages. Report in appropriate messages. There are. I think this would instead be report the users. Yeah, this would not, wouldn't be report the message, but report the user itself. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think there's one more one missing screen for those in terms of flow. But I will add it. Before in appropriate. Okay. And check. Yeah, we can skip this. That's not there. This can be just scratched off. It's precious. And check. Not. No need. Okay, I'm writing it. Yeah. No need. Okay. 10 gifts. Yeah, we have covered it. View chat history. We cover it. 10 video. We cover it. 10 wise. Not we cover it. Delete. 10 messages. It's not particularly on the. I mean, we are using like, you know, what we were discussing about. No, let's okay with it actually. Yeah. Okay. So it isn't the screen, but the flow of how it is. It's not there. Let me always add it. Okay. But the messages. We send messages. Yeah. These messages. Okay. React to messages. They are typing indicators. They read recipient. Their. Profile level up. Yeah. They are. Yeah. They are. It was there. As I use a Vena E purchase. The point experience points are added to my profile level. If how they will be added based on the. From buy a points and the daily challenges. Right. Yeah. Okay, purchase coins. There we need. I need to get like, you know, Oh, there is no. You know, purchasing. Caps there. Okay, what will be the purchases chat if I click on any coin? What will happen? And. No, after that. We need to get more after that is we discussed this is that it will be handled by the app store or Apple or Play Store or Google or Android. All right. So when you go when you see any of the packages you select and you click continue, it will just take your automatically the repayment. Like because it's on because it's on mobile devices. Right. We can. So the stores themselves, they will take care of purchasing. Or Play Store. Okay, not the app store. Apple payment. Okay, so gifting options. We covered it. If purchase is free, we don't have a strings. All purchases. We will add. We will add. So be in setting. So this is this way. View guidelines. I guess these are privacy policy, right? Hello. Am I cutting now? Sorry. Am I breaking? And it is my wife breaking? Hello. Is my wife breaking? I'm not. I think you're slightly cutting this one. Yeah. I think we can't be able to break this on. All right. All right. I got. Guide internet connection. All right. So here we were. We were on. View guidelines. Right, mom? Right. Where are we? We were on view guidelines. Yeah, I was saying that this will be added. The screens will be added for this. View guidelines. Is that not the same screen that we have for the privacy policy and terms and conditions? Yeah. All right. Correct. But I just have to add that section in the settings too. So they can see it in the settings. Because after the log in, there is no way to see it. So it would just be an additional screen for that. All right. All right. Okay. Just give me a. Okay. So, uh, feedback reporting. That's what we have seen, right? Uh, we have seen that. We will add that. Sorry. We will add that to the missing screen. Feedback reporting. Yeah. Feedback reporting. In a section blocking. Just remove this. Sorry. In a section. Yeah, we can just remove. You remove. We need to remove it. Okay. And I've had a section. Just remove this. Blocking option. We don't have a. That is. Yeah. Right. We don't. It's for the chats. There you can just block the user delete the chat. Okay. Delete chat. Delete chat or block the user. But there's the thing. Confirmation that's missing that will be at. Okay. Blocking option confirmation screen will be added. Blocking option. Confirmation. It will be. It will be. Object. All right. Okay. So. Nexus notification references. What we have here. That. As I you are going to best mine notification. Your friend receiver element alerts. Okay. What is this? This is the. Test. Modification. This is the push notifications and marketing notifications where you can toggle them. Either user I want to update my email. But I am not taking any email. In profile section. In the settings you can. In the setting I can add. Yes. File picture name update. Picture update. Display name update. Level progression view. As I use the. Level progression view. As I will be able to see my level progression in my profile. So it will be the same just. Just a bar right with the level. Publishing right. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Link accounts. What are those? Okay. Google. Can I link multiple accounts in a single account? Or not? So the one account for. Yeah, this is a missing screen. Link accounts. Yeah. I think it can only have one account link at the same time. But if you want to link another. Disconnect that account to link another account. We can. See that. Okay. But the. Can we link one one more than one account? Like suppose if we have two accounts right. We logged out and see if we have another account like we have on the Facebook. Can we do that? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, if we have two accounts in our in our in our app. Okay. And from our profile setting, we can see. If we want to we can see that another account there. And we click it this one. This first account get logged out. And we directly get into that account. Like. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we can do that. Like from the different account. I want to log in. So. Yeah, we can do that. Okay. That's good. Okay. That's good. Okay. That's good. That's good. Okay. That's the language references can be. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So we have four months. I'm on the can we cover rest of the points tomorrow? If it's being fine. Yeah. Sure. It's not a problem. Okay. Uh, so okay. Now we can we can cover the performance in our liability tomorrow. As honestly as very straightforward, there is no screens for any of these. All right. Except maybe the notifications. Uh, this is not the there is no there is no screens for any of these. These are just more of how the app should perform. Yes. So we have covered this and we know down the you know down what the screens we are missing from there. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. We tomorrow we will cover admin panel which from the document. Okay. Yeah. And we will discuss on packages and tools that and third parties of that we are using which which is which is taking our price. Okay. Okay. Now one more thing Hassan is you know, I think at this time it's good to start bringing up the architecture diagrams. How everything is going to be architecture? Yes. You know what a deal is. You know, once everything is clear, the what the habit of a deal is that you create an ERD. Okay. You create an ERD diagram for the backend database. Okay. So I will run everything is clear and we are with respect to everything. My functionality features everything are clear. And deal will create a detailed ERD for this platform. And I will share that ERD with you. Okay. That is a vacant architecture diagram for our program. All right. Correct. I understand that. But I think an architecture diagram in general of how everything will be connected is also good to have. Just so we're just so we know how we're building this and how we're structuring it to at the same time. And ERD is yes. And here it is fantastic. It's great. But I think an architecture diagram would also be helpful in listening to visualizing. Yeah. It would be good to visualize how everything is structuring. I'll just try it all now. Okay. If this is something that I can create for you. I can create for you. I will share it with you once the backend of a deal finalizes things. From those things, I will you know, create an IRGIT actually. I know for you. Okay. Wonderful. Okay. So shall we also confirm tomorrow's meeting time now? Yeah. We can.
