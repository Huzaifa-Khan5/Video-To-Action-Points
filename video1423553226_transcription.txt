 Good morning Okay, so let's start the thing First of all I'm going to share my image with me They're trying to implement a customized 404 page But they're saying they can't hit a 404 page because it just goes into a 302 redirect Yeah Because we implement that if there's any 404 and we can redirect to You home I think About the if the chef was not available or the menu is not available Okay, all right. I'll find out how crucial that is to S. Yeah, then How about the the travel fees Sorry The travel fees is that whole issue fixed now Yeah, it's already fixed on But Monday right Okay, yeah And then um the last thing I have the uh, I know we scrapped the whole calendar thing for the additional services for the chefs We were chatting a deal, but we need that calendar for service providers So like this service provider will create their availability I can't do services right Right So when they add there so when you choose it from the front end You may need to choose a date I would probably just have it uh, I would probably just have it defaulted to choosing a date For from an external service provider Not a chef Um, okay, let me show let me show you the service provider uh Uh flow of the calendar so we can understand better Okay I Know as the Airbnb do that If they if someone rents a house And then they have a chef Did they have to come the same night How do they choose the day? Can you know Repeat that I'm sorry So if somebody books one of the chefs on Airbnb, right they they choose let's say the the 10th of April Yeah, but they want dinner on the 12th They have to choose two dates one for the house one for the chef Correct. Yeah, it's a totally separate transaction Were you able to hear me? Yeah, yeah, we're waiting on uh deal here. Do you have the calendar pulled up a deal? Yeah I wonder can you demo that him or no for the Uh chef yeah For how the customer reserves it Yeah, I wonder if we should do that similarly for the additional services Like as far as you know choosing a second date Yeah Let me get set up give me two seconds Okay I need to I need the sharing turn on ideal Okay, so how Airbnb does it is they first have you reserve your your home And then you've got your experiences right here Mike. This is the customer I was so you can't even add you can't even do both together you have to do them You have to do separate Oh Yeah, so when they come in Just say Charleston Adder dates I mean you can add multiple dates if you want that thing you can you can put in your guess whatever it is And then it gives you the option for you have to sort down to that and then you find which Which one you want to go to So how did it go? Uh were you already on experiences? I thought you were on housing I wasn't housing at the very top So at the very top of Airbnb Oh, why do I that did that now After you book Mm-hmm when you're at the top of the screen let me back up here Once you've booked your home this little experience is shows up here Oh, that's I hate that Yeah Okay, I well, I think ours our plan is way better is adding it on I agree totally agree And I mean the experience if for and just just so you see it the experience coming in here That's wrong one But if let's just pick one date Pick And then if you pick you have to pick food and drink which makes sense because it's a lot of different experiences um What's interesting it like this one isn't ours It's one of our chefs, but he went straight on with take a chef Um, but here's what's interesting is There's no menus no nothing in this whole thing So you can pick 108 per person When you choose that oh well you can't go do anything right now get an error message But anyways um, there's there's no menu there there's nothing so they have to chat back and forth with the chef for with me as the concierge Come up with the menu and then I manually change the price point based on whatever menu they pick So our whole process is so much better Yeah, that's horrible It's terrible I deal you ready I'm already one Yeah I was just sorry Look in this uh, yeah, look nice green Okay, so this is your service provider So right now service providers go to their have under So I want to create the I of Apple I can choose my services whatever the service I want You can choose multiple I can choose one on I can choose my time right and just created Right Mike Right what what if you um What if you only choose one of your can you can you choose one of your services for the 15th and 16th and then and then go and then add it For let's just say all three times and then can you go back in and add the second service For a different time You think did same date Yeah Right now Uh if you click on the 15 you can see all the services With the Each of the first service time so on the three times Right and if I want to add And the service So it's true with the same duration Let's choose a back first and lunch and click add so it will be added In the same duration already Is that you want Right, they should be able to have two different services at two different times for the same dates too. Yeah So This is the only thing you want it right What what I you mean what I was talking about originally like at the start of the meeting Hmm No, I was I was talking I'm talking about the front end So if like if a host books a chef for The 10th of April Yeah, and then they go into the additional services But they want a A tour of the city or whatever right a ghost tour They are able to choose a date a Different date like the 12th Okay You see what I'm saying so that ad button Would have to be a get started to choose a date or like a choose date button or something And they could choose the same date as the dinner where they could choose a different date for a service And let's say I choose a 26 Uh, six people Is beyond race Typically a petal is the optional one So here is our services For the show Right So like we said so any chef added services Would be the ad plus because they would be same day Right But if we have an external service provider That I mean Realistically provides anything like uh, but you know a tour of a city or maybe like You know like a beauty supplier they do like the nails and hair or anything This in at this point Instead of the ad plus it would need to be you know when you click that ad plus it would have to say I don't know um get started or Yeah, and you would have to choose a date because the date could potentially be different The date of the 26 Does that make sense So If the service is provided by the chef it will directly add it right right Uh, if the Service is provided by a service provider Then there will be an option to choose the date Right Right The date will be the same Correct But it would only populate if it's available on the 26 Actually Maybe should always populate it Because if they want a different date then Yeah, I think you I think we'd have to always populate Service provider If it's an external service provider let's say okay, here's the use case The dinners on the 26 right Uh, someone's offering Uh, a tour of Charleston right But they're not available on the 26 However, they're available on the 27th 28th and 29th right Right And they don't want they don't want the tour the same day as the 26 so they're able to from here choose the 27th So in that case The uh the service providers will have to show up regardless if they're available on the 26 Does that make sense? Start uh The service provider will always be shown With uh on the Optional courses as an optional services If they're in the area yes, yeah, if they're in the same area as what you know, whatever you selected here They would always have to populate If if they have I guess if they have a availability right but um The dates would be different they don't have to have the 26th to populate So Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense So I guess when you click that get started button You know, maybe I don't know I guess maybe it would be a popup or uh the calendar would just uh Ensure the calendar directly or do like if you click on it the calendar will be shown like that I Think that might be a little I would rather have it kind of in here Where your mouse is either a drop down with the calendar or A popup Because then they're gonna take their choosing a different date for the dinner What about the damn switch For the time I think okay then I guess maybe the best option is a popup fine for the uh the date and the time Yeah, but I'm wondering if um I wonder I wonder if we should make the time even more specific I Think we're gonna have Yeah, I think we are Yeah, it deal um I think we're gonna have to mess with the time too Yeah Like we're gonna have to for the and again, I think this is just for the service providers The the service providers are gonna have to go Oh, well no actually I guess that's fine because When you choose a time Right now you choose every 30 minutes in check out right Yeah, so yeah, so it's you're gonna need to choose the The uh the date um The time in 30 minute blocks not the not the big block for breakfast lunch dinner Like Like this Yeah for on the front end yes for for the For the additional service, but I think it it should be in that popup Yeah, this is just for the dinner right Yeah, so a deal this is just for the dinner, but in the popup for the additional service you're gonna have to choose I've a half hour time frame Like it would be Get started with the the tour the same thing. Yes So they would have to do Uh get started choose the date Uh and then choose the time in 30 minute blocks But not the get started from the menu where you choose your time block The breakfast lunch dinner it has to be this For the additional service. Yeah, it will be only showing the the time frame Not the breakfast lunch dinner option right right in Right in the the optional course. Yeah, right You pop up But here's the thing we're we're gonna have to have uh I think we're gonna have to change the availability calendar for the additional services Because if they're just choosing a large time frame, let's say from Nine to I can't remember what it is nine to 12 or whatever They might not be available for all those hours like if it's a tour right They might only have nine And nine thirty times slots available But that's it Do you see what I'm saying? So if you can you go back to the availability calendar In service to ardent Yeah Yeah, I think here so that the choose time the deal Under there needs to be in 30 minute increments So The time here at availability So again, this if this is a service provider And Instead of choosing nine to 12 p.m They may only have like nine nine thirty and ten available But not 12 right or not Not 11 not 12 right and in in the one and four o'clock time block They may only have 230 available Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes me think I'm thinking about the How should we show on here Because right now it's showing the only type of system So One more thing The time frame will be always with like the same First Blanchett winner or There'll be any 24 hours Uh, I mean, I guess it could be I guess it could be 24 hours. I don't know what Serve of someone would book it at one in the morning, but I'm sure we haven't thought of everything Well, let's do one thing. Oh Maybe you just do it at 24 24 20 you know 24 hours in 30 minute increments And they just check blocks all of the Everything that's available I can So let's do one thing. I will provide in the time selector Right With the duration of 30 minutes So I So let's say you select 9 a.m. 30 Right Okay, so you can select More than one The time frame with the blocks of 30 minutes I Take the UI Yeah, maybe if you Um If you check the 9 a.m. The 12 p.m. You can get a drop down And then check off the boxes for Which half hour blocks in that time frame? I don't know what I mean I guess at this point whatever's easier. It's got to look nice. I think you'd look good Yeah Okay, and then on the front end If they're choosing the time in the half hour blocks You're gonna have to have some that are Like gray that you can't choose And the ones that are you're able to choose or either they're missing or they're gray whichever is I guess easier I think it will be amazing Okay, that's fine So is that the service provider is that's on dev or local host So on it Local right now Okay, I need to change the calendar functionality Uh, because we just got that about the missing So I want I will update that According to that Uh, one more thing uh like if I select the time frame service provider uh while you do a booking right So Is there effect on the booking or What will you use case of that like my booking is on Kindly six of April and I choose the Like um my fifth of me All right for The service provider, but I I choose two different services one is for the chef Right and the one is for the service provider the chef will be on the 26th of The same date of the booking right but the service provider will be Uh the fifth of me right, so how it will be looks uh look on the how it will show on the booking details or it will be any I have like Any detail solution or whatever what will be the use case of that Okay Because right now If the date is passed of like the booking date is passed We are not allowing the user to cancel or whatever the feature is right now So what yeah, I think if if it's a if it's a chef added Additional service it all just gets baked into the reservation with um With the it's probably going to be a different commission percentage So you're going to have to have two different commission percentages for the additional service So the dinner is 30% and the service is 10% or whatever right and then they just get added together and then sent over but for the additional services with an external On the customer side it'll probably look the same where they have Their dinner and then the service the different date the different time Whatever it is right but on our side on the admin side there should be another tab with service reservations Does that make sense? So it should be a totally separate reservation I didn't get that can be So instead of just the reservations for the dinners There needs to be you know, maybe a dropdown in on that tab with service reservations And it would it would just be Whatever the service is right it would look like a reservation for a dinner, but it would be a service reservation And that's when you would see all of the details on that service reservation So the dinner would close on the 26th But the service reservation would close on the date of that so let's say the 28th right Or if they're both on the 26th they both close on the 26th Or like What if we wanted to print out for the services For things In admin yeah, yeah, I thought that's what I just said It's that yeah the If it's a different tab or if it's a dropdown on reservations, I mean same difference And then the top is just service reservations And it just shows all the details and we're also going to need what What reservation it's paired with in those details just so you know So what about the post review and the chef view so let's say So it will do a separate tab for the host to or No, the host should just get the the one reservation With all the details in it with the service the date the different date if there's a different date the time How much they spent basically the same thing just grouped together The chef should only get The additional service that they provided if it was added Yeah, but if an external added they wouldn't get it But I so I'm gonna challenge that a little bit Mike Because if it's if it's a bartender paired with the chef that night They probably both there should be a reference for both of them to know the contact on the other one Because what's going to happen say that the bartender's late or say that the chef is late When they show up The customer's going to come to them and go where is the other person and if they have no contact information So I do think that if it's appearing I think they should at least have Reference to what else is being booked Yeah, that's fine. Okay deal the then the customer and the chef will just have the same Reservation but the admin will just be separated So Kim I see the details of the service provider or the chef The chef contact details is already been there in the chef's side right Right So like if I If I added the External service provider So it's the chef able to see that details or not Yeah, they should be able to see the contact details I can like the both the both can see the both the details Right so that if they have to communicate with each other for any reason All in the contact details on the pricing and all that yeah Yeah, not the pricing or anything You Now I'm thinking all that stuff which discuss I just I found any other use case or any Situation which is it shouldn't be handled I will let you know on the slacker Okay Ah Is it possible that um I can get a link to play with this or now The local hose I will update that first which you just kept now then we can publish on the dev web Yeah, then we can play with that Okay, is that gonna be today I'm gonna show the notes that show the gen by one day Yeah, okay I Want to read you that this things the time for Okay Um, you provided the feedback on the admin side I think it's for the description somehow my personal Yeah, yeah, remember we said Uh For the um chef provided We Enter the description and then when they choose it They could either keep that description Or they could edit edit that placeholder description Right When they're adding it into the menu Yeah, I was missing And then the other thing that's missing is the login as service provider I don't know if you could just add that yet but Or if it was ever locked Okay, because right now we don't push the these things So that's why we didn't add that yeah, but it will be added Okay What else I think that's all I have Yeah Yeah, I think No um The only other thing that I'm thinking about is like I wonder if they should If it's like a service that Uh Or maybe they it would be kind of frustrating to choose every single time If you know if uh If you had all of the times Like if you had from 9am until 11pm It would be kind of annoying to choose every single 30 minute block for each one So Does that does that make sense like if if it was a service that you did have every single one So I would make it I would make it so a deal that you could choose Choose all or choose you know large blocks at once versus having to choose Every single 30 minute time frame Does that make sense So it's the option either or So like Discuss we will provide it 24 hours section So we will provide the two options over there like um 24 hours or the Selecting and multiple time frames Um Well, I I think I think going yeah, I mean this is I would keep the 9 to 11. I don't know that we really need 24 hours. I can't imagine anyone's gonna do anything before 9 I mean, maybe they will with like if it's like a house they would Yeah All right, that's fine 24 hours, but yeah, I mean, I think they should they should have An option to choose Multiple at once I'm just I'm I'm thinking into the future here more than anything is when we provide housing If someone adds a their vacation rental, I don't want them to have to choose a Time like a 30 minute increment. They should be choosing um A date and I mean realistically, I guess it's just probably a date and the Uh check-in would be at Whatever they choose for 30 or whatever um All right Yeah, all right, that's fine. I guess for now with I guess we'd cross that bridge when the time comes and maybe we just make it this pop up a little bit different For uh because we'll probably have a different tab anyway for Uh Housing All right, that's fine. But deal we can go forward with this All right, is that it? Yep Okay, um, all right, I'll get back to you on that 4042 Yeah And then we're good on the chat with we don't need any more numbers. I haven't seen anything come through for it Yeah, I think just um, I think we have kept in right Hmm, I think so yeah, I think it's enough for now I'm wondering if that every time that we go past that though And then someone sends a message and then we get that email that says that you know it hasn't been assigned a number or whatever And one of every time that happens The chat breaks It it seems like from what I've seen that that that's what's happening That the cron job or whatever you're talking about Uh and then Tim stops getting the emails the the chef stop getting texts and emails Uh, I'll do all like that uh We can see to the different but I'll take that I think there's more connection between that I will I'll update you on that Okay All right, thank you guys Thank you again Choose it. I haven't asked me can I have you two have a go on
