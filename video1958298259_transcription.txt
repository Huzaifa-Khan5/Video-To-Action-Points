 Okay, so let's start with the things on the machine machine first. So which we are discussing in the group. So let's open that first. So you mentioned that the, the loyalty point will be independent, right? So right now there is no loyalty pension because I didn't like the country. I select the country. Right, there we get checkbox shown, show loyalty points. If I select that, then it will be shown. I did not select the discount type either cashback discount or anything. It's independent right now. Is that you want correct? Correct, but select now cashback. Okay. Yes, now we can select either cashback loyalty points. Yes, exactly. This is what I want. Okay. So this is published on the production right now. So you can also check that. Okay. Actually, it's not show loyalty points. Sorry. It's not show loyalty points. What will be a label? It should be enable show loyalty on enable loyalty points. Okay. And if it's not enabled, it will not show as an option for cashback. Sorry. I can enable all disabled loyalty points. Okay. Like this. So this show is actually enabled. Okay. Not show. Okay. And if I don't enable it, it will not show as an option, right? You're both on for the cashback time. So this is dependent on this cashback type. No, it's not dependent on cashback type. Cashback type is dependent on it. So if I don't disable loyalty points, how can I select it for cashback? I cannot, right? Again, again, again. So you said if I let's say I remove that discount type. Okay. So it's independent. Either I enable it or disable it, right? Loyalty points. Okay. Yes. So if I select cashback and I did not select the enable, I did not enable. Loyalty points. So what will be a case then? So there will be no option for loyalty points in cashback. This state enabled. Yes. So the higher level is enabled loyalty points. This is higher than cashback. And even when you put it in the form, put it on top of it. It's not dependent on cashback. So this will, like it will be shown. So I will decide whether this tenant has loyalty points or not. And if I decide it has, I can configure it. Then when I select cashback type, I can select whether cashback type has loyalty points or cash if the loyalty points are enabled. So this enabled loyalty points will be on the top of the discount type. Yes. Okay. And if I not select not enable loyalty points and I select cashback, then cashback type will be not showing. Yes. Or maybe so show only cash. Something like this and disable loyalty points. No, just confirmed. So either should we not show this or should we only show this cash. Show the cash and show the show the cash selected and the loyalty points disabled. Like we are showing like this here in the discount amount type. It's unable to disable. Yes. Something like this. Yeah. The cash will be directly selected. Right. And it will not be like deselect, correct? If there's not enabled. And loyalty points would be disabled. The next one, yeah, this one. The one next to cash. Yeah, yeah. If I not enable that. Yes. Okay. By the way, I did not understand the purpose which we have done here. So. Okay. I didn't tell you insist to link in your mind that loyalty points is cashback. There is no relation between them. There is no relation. There is no relation between cashback and loyalty points. Yeah, this is right now. There's no relation with the cashback and loyalty points. But which we've done right now, like you requested to prove that which is enabled is equal thing. So I didn't understand why you did that. So that's why. Okay. Which one you did not understand. No, like the logic. So I put that enable loyalty points and that above the discount tab, right? And if it's not selected, then the loyalty points will be disabled and cash will be enabled. Right. Yes. So because previously it was also that's like previously it was something like that, but it was a same center of that. But that's why. No, it wasn't actually this before. Okay. Before you were showing the configuration of loyalty points, when you see the loyalty points of cashback. Okay. Yeah. What I'm trying to explain, I think maybe it's still not clear for you is that. I can still have loyalty points if I don't have cashback very simply. Yeah. Right now you have it. It is direct. Yes. So what's the what's the complicated thing here? Okay. Let's find them. Okay. So I didn't have this already there product or service. I think which you already seen that. The rest of the things I can already explain to you in the video, right. And about the talent. And if I go to activity. And go to the details of the activity. So previously we added the. These things in here. This will be removed. And it will be added in the. In here, right item item type you will be requesting the message that you wanted in the activity creation. Correct. Yes. Sorry. Hello. What what the. What the. What the. What the. What the. So you requested that. Your message. Let me see. Okay. This was that. Product or service selection can only add to activity level and call it item type. Okay. So in the second message, you mentioned that this actually should be added in the create or added activity, not activity level pricing. Should I highlight that point. This one. Have you checked. I'm not even. Yes, you're all the. Is that right, right? Which you requested. Add item type in the activity career form. A product service or both. Activity level and code item type, not tenant type. Can I explain it again. This one. I think you forgot. I think you forgot. Yeah, I think you forgot that. Let me explain it again. So just give me some time. Enter you are asking me like if I said it now, or yesterday. No, I'm not. This one. Actually, should be able to create or add activity, not activity level pricing. I think you forgot. Is anybody speaking. Yes, this one. This one should not be added to activity level pricing. Yeah, activity level pricing. It says for it is. It applies for everything in the activity for as a price point of view. For example, I want to say that. Everything under this activity has 30% discount. But I should not add product or service in activity level pricing. I should add it into the create or add added activity. Yes, this should be added. That correct. I did where activity. Create. Okay. You are sure confused, I think. I'm not confused. I'm very clear to what I'm saying. I said, I do. Create or edit. So here you are adding this is create or edit. Did you add it to create an edit activity? Yeah, this is the add activity. And I added the item type, which is either a product or service or both. Yes. And you removed it from activity level pricing. Okay. Why you did not remove it? Yeah, we removed it, but it's not published here. We already removed it. From here, but it's not published. It will be published soon. Item type. Okay. Okay. Okay. What else? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You tell me what ends. The other things that you requested about the product and service in the video. So it's not done yet. After that, after finishing these items, we will work on it. The last part. Okay. Okay. But I instill insist we work through videos or the group, although obviously we are facing difficulty because we don't want to hypernet until we until the time of the week limiting. So we will keep working during this time. Yeah. Yeah. We were like we are conversation in the videos. So yeah. Okay. Okay. So that's it. Yes. And it's missing. Am I. If I'm okay, it doesn't mean that I remember that you execute. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Product of Civil Selection can be added to Activate Event Code at Item Time. Brand worker June 18 Library And Yes, or no? No. So ask again. I understand. What are the points? Did you do it both for tenant and create tenants? Yes. Because last time you did it for one of them. No, it was already did it for the boat, but you like some points, which I already mentioned that it should not select a country that's why it's not trying. Can I show you? No, and so what you are showing me is published or not? Yeah, published, which I already showed in the video in the meeting. Right here, and add tenant still not done. Still do it points. The civil share. Who's the civil attendee screen share? Check the admin. No, I'm just available. Attendant is still there is no. No, can please share your screen please. I enabled that screen sharing. Here, this is tenant, right? Okay. So still do it points. I reloaded the page. Okay, now it's okay. Where is now asset of the country? Okay, so you will update this later. Same for the tenant. Okay. Okay. Okay. What, what about other things like this email admin? Sorry? The email admin thing I told you I want to test it or be covered in that email. Yeah, yeah, it's not done yet. I will update you on that. I will let you know on the group once we stand. Like what other things like this? The other things only that the thing you should share the video. I think it's for yesterday about the product and the service. So one thing. So now we need to remove the model the pop up from that tenant. We need to convert this into a screen because these two there's too many items in the model right now. Which is not good for the model because we need to add the create for create a screen for that. And need to continue on the work on the screen. Okay. Even for product. Which you yeah, which you shared the video. Oh, the last part. I'm okay. And I will share another video. So you can work on it on Monday. Okay. Shalom. Shalom. So. Okay. If we are done, I think. As and you wanted to discuss something about my stones. Yeah. Yes. Yes. You can. You can. You can leave now. Okay. Ali. Basically. I have shared first of all on the first my list one. We have I have shared the both, you know, front end code and the backend code which you acknowledge on the group that you have shared that with. Staff, right. Yes. Okay. So my second milestone is also completed, you know. On this we have this item right like. The offer creation in the motion. Can you please share. Can you share your screen. Yes. Ali, can you please stop here? Just give us your. Okay. So can you see my screen? Yes. Okay. I will ask. Yes. Why are you? Can we add safe to the group? Why? Why? What is the I told you last week and you did not do anything about this? No, no, I have shared this list with you, you know, on the group. You shared what? This link with you. No, I'm not talking about the link. I'm talking that I asked you to add safe to the group to make me admin and check with Mohammed and get back to me last Monday. You did not get a last Tuesday. No, no, no. That is my bed. I mean, this is my bed. Okay. Can you share the safe number? I mean, I will ask Mohammed to, you know, add him on the group as well. Okay. This is my bed. I will do it. Okay. Okay. So, basically our second milestone was completed, my long-term or go-na. So, that has these items like approval systems for brand, merchant users and agents. In these items, as both, you know, the backend and the front end all are completed. So, this is considered as a complete milestone. Yes, it's completed. Yes. Okay. So, on this, beside this milestone, we have UI, UX development milestone as well. In which, you remember, I have shared the website UI design and mobile app UI design, timbiting with you. Remember? And you have approved them as well. Remember? Or I should share them again for your review, but the website and the mobile app you have given you are approved. The test pack for design. No, no. I'll share it again. There is something, two things here. When you say, you are UX. Yeah. The design, like, how does it feel? What is the color? What is the phone? Yes. Yes. Yes. Now, you are talking about what, which one of them? I am talking about the design. Use your journey. The user journey. Yeah. Yeah. I am talking about the design. I'm not sure, actually. No. The website that Adeel has built was basically based upon that design, right? Yeah. I think it is. I think it is. So, it's. I think it is. I think it is. It is. It is. The design. We. We created a big, big, my design. So, this is about that. I think my design. Yeah. Yeah. You do. It is linked screens. Yeah. Can I navigate from one screen to another and simulate how the how this will work or not? No. Yes. No. No. No. Basically, the design is actually a picture. Okay. The US design is actually a picture which shows how your website will look like. It actually shows the view. So, that's what you have made from us. And we had that my list. Right. And we show you the design. And you had approved that. So, that's why after that, we move towards the development of your website. After your approval. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Say it. Say it. What you want to say. Share your screen now. Show me what you shared. And I approved. Just to make cut the dynamic story short. Just give me a second. I need. I need to find the thing. Okay. Just give me a second. Look. Just give me a second. Look. Just give me a second. Look. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now- Okay. Okay. Yeah. I am sharing my screen. Just give me a moment. Okay.aré. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. you you you you Ali did you see my screen yes Okay Ali the screen that I am referring was this website So, I will click play here. Just click play that means actually you can see check. Okay. So, I am referring this design. And yes, which we already developed. And it has all, you know, this is the home page of the design. And the can you also share me the link of the website that we developed. So, Ali can give the confirmation. Okay. So, this was the home page from the design. This discussion was finished when we were discussing this last time. Yeah, yeah. This discussion was finished. No, this discussion wasn't. I remember here I gave a comment about this foot water. And the last comment I gave was that we cannot exactly copy that website. And we need to make something about this. Yes, yes. This was changing the development. Okay. This was changing the development. Okay. And this is the just in here. Let me copy it and show you now on the exact website that we developed. Okay. Many things were changed. As this is functional as well. So, you know, yeah. This is how it looks like now as compared to the website. Okay. The footer is totally changed on the development point of it. Why the photo looks like this? Because you told us that you don't need to copy things like footers that design. Okay. So, these things are career as well as where are they now here. Sorry. Back. Yeah, these things here. Where are they in the other one? Because the links are there and we had only, you know, right now we had this one page about us. And we had it. What about the footer? I'm talking about footer. Yeah, because we don't have these pages. And we only had the pages that we had. We are only making up, make up, making those pages on the footer. I'm just showing you that this discussion shows that we did not close this discussion. No, no, no. I don't know. This hotel I never saw before. I'll wait for the site end now. Okay. Adil, can you confirm this to me? This is the footer was approved on this. And we had. We had closed the discussion previously, right? We discussed about the footers things that we don't want the same copy of the kids. So we discussed that we will show something like that, too early. And which is a result about it that that's okay for that. So early. So about the pages, which is showing in the design. So we discussed that there is no, we have no blogs and that stuff, right? So that's why we should like minimize the footer, which we, which is, we already discussed that which is controlled from the panel. The annual panel, right? It's a thing that brings the different policy, the conditions and the. The privacy policy. So these pages are there in the back end, the panel, I think panel where you can control that. Each video is because a couple of time ago. I don't want to complicate things or put the. I don't know something in the wheel. I'm just telling you, you never showed me this footer. So this might mean that something else I didn't see. This footer here is we had last discussion. You said we will configure, we will, it will be dynamic. You can't do it from the admin. Anyway. What else I didn't see or I did not check here. How send me this link, I will check, okay? Yes, you can check. I will make it complicated for you. Just send me this link. Okay, okay. You can have a link. I will be sharing it to you now. Okay. Thank you. I'm sharing the. Also, here, this one is not developed right for the mobile app. The mobile app, I am sharing both. Okay, I am sharing both design. Okay, and then you can have a look and let me know. I mean, you're saying for website is developed, but for mobile app, it's not developed right. It's only designed. I am only referring, you know, I am with respect to third milestone. I am only referring the design. Okay, that design, the non clickable design. Okay, which has no functionality, no, you know, now coding etc. Okay, only the picture from the look and feel how it looks like. Okay. I will not make it complicated for you. Just send me to review. I will make it easy for you. Okay. Okay, you can move on. Okay. What other milestones you want to do this? Yes, the time and guess what you're doing over there. I know. So. That's my stone 3.1 and offer redemption, which was merchant manage offers looking merchant user dashboard. Adele on this, this was also this is also completed right. Scroll down please. Scroll up little bit. Hold on a second. So in the 3.1, some part of the things are completed like merchant user authentication, login, profile management, scroll down please at the ability to for merchant user. No, that's not still down. Still down. In short, few items from this milestone are remaining right. So accept the order, which is except the things which is related to the order. All are done. Yeah, this is incomplete, right? This is incomplete, right? In short, we will consider it in one. 3.1 is incomplete. It's not good. Okay. Okay. No, no point of discussing that. Okay. What about my stone 4? It's not because it's connected with the milestone 3.1. Okay. Okay. So decide this. Adele, there were some, you know, additional items like which in which we have implemented the backend as well. Okay. We haven't had the discussion on it. Right? So like those message enhancements, writing page UI design and API integration terms and condition, which has terms and condition upload banner something like that wasn't, you know, initial discussion. Right? So these were, that's why we named this as an additional items, right? These things we didn't discuss on the start when we were progressing towards this. Okay. Adele, let's move to this part. To host message enhancement, these things is completed and implemented, right? Correct. Both front end and backend. Yeah. And writing page UI design and API integration. These things front end and backend are done. Yep. It's done. What do you mean by front end? Category management update. This one is done in front end. Just hold on a second. I'll be, I'll be, hold on a second. Okay. Okay. So yeah, on this, what you were saying. I'm saying, what has done here? What do you mean by done? Yeah, what do you mean by done? I mean, the things that were, that was the wasn't discussed on the start. And you have told them in between the projects, we count them as an. What is this? Hostage and asked. You know, there was some tools. Adele can better explain it. Adele, can you explain this thing? It's about the, I mean, remember, there was an inline errors. Like where you mentioned that it should be sharing the tools message. Okay. I remember looking, next point, setting up. Where do you design an API integration? So this is about which we are here. Here, here, wait, wait, if you are telling me setting up. Where do you design an API integration for this one? It means if I go to the backend and configure terms and conditions and go to the link you gave me, it will show. Right? Correct. So I should be able to test this. Sorry. I should be able to test this. And I should change it from the backend and see it in the front end. Yes. So I will, okay, I will test this. What is, what is the category management update? And then I could feel to the add edit categories. And able to dynamic sorting. This one, I don't think this is done. It's about the first point is the add icon and the calculating category. Right? And the other point is remember, before the eat, we lost it is because the dynamic. I remember, I remember, but I'm saying, can I test this? Yeah, and you can I change in the backend, see it in the front end? No, so you can change it on the backend, but it's not reflect on the front end right now. So you then how can we say this is done? So on the admin side, we can say that it's done by the admin side, but on the website implementation is not done yet. Okay. Actually, actually, actually everything in the front end, I consider is not done. Why? Because the link you shared to me, if it's developed, if it's developed, if it's not only a design, it should be one of the tenants. Yeah, and you should have at least one tenant configured. Regardless of the things that we are discussing that we did not develop it, but whatever is developed in the backend. So you should show me that this is related to the tenant, but I don't think this is done. You should have one tenant configured in the backend and reflected in the front end. So if this is not done, how we are saying that so many all of these are done. And that's why if you remember, I gave you a domain and we did the DNS redirection and so on. And we said we will end this domain. You will show me one tenant so that I see how we configure in the admin one tenant, how which we'll show in this domain. So if all of this is not done, I don't think we need to discuss anything related to the front end so far. I mean, you need to understand one thing right. And the front end and the admin side things are linked to each other, but you know they are functional on the admin. You know, we have the end points that we connect on the from the admin to the front end, but on the admin side, whatever the things you are dynamically adding, they are showing on the admin. Okay, this is that is not just a front end. That's a total functionality that we did on the admin panel. Okay, so if you see my things like if I told you like here, I have mentioned, I haven't mentioned about the tenant of the site. I am only referring about the admin panel, not the actual website. If you can test it on the admin panel, okay, if you can test it on the admin panel and it's showing that it means it's working and it's fine. You know, that's what I am trying to explain. That's what I understand. Okay, very good. But is there any other thing above that that is related to the front end? Any milestone? I will let you know, just give me a word and let's scope it up and you can in between, I will describe that. Okay, if something is related to front end, I will mention for end time. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, so next thing is category. This is not an offer. Scored up. Research password feature will be removed. Line number 91, the two word card, I've been paneled. Just remove that. Okay, and above also above one. Yeah, that's not an option. Okay, yeah, I told guard on the admin panel. Ali, that was a tour guide on admin panel. Did we show it to Ali? Yeah, can you, did you want to see that again? I saw it, I saw it. You saw it? Okay, that's fine. Okay, tenant offer attachment. These are only tenant offer attachment enabled from standard to attach and display offers. This directly within tenant profiles and better user engagement. This is done functionally or it is just a front end. It's just for UI. It just for you. Okay, Ali, do you know what is this point? It's about the initial thing, Ali. We remember we discussed once we are starting the offer level pricing and attaching the tenants and the offers like that. It's about the offer level pricing and tenant level pricing. So these are these things that you are I think. Okay, this after this thing, like from 93 onwards, these are the current items that we are in which we have only developed the front end. Okay, we haven't developed the back end of these things. Okay. Okay, we haven't developed so Ali, you need to discuss about the first of all, if we talk about the second milestone. If we talk about the second milestone, it is completed and it has been upchecked by you as well. So you need to pay that milestone to Muhammad. And after that, we will share the code and the front end of these milestone, these things that are on milestone with two views. Okay, that we give for the first milestone. All right. All right. All right. Okay, perfect. Secondly, on the third milestone, you are reviewing. You need to review. I have shared the votes, figmo links for mobile app and the wherever we can discuss that on our next one, which is on Tuesday. Okay, you can review it. This must be you are saying it's not completed. So once you complete, you are should be leading this. You tell me we completed this and you go through with this. Okay. The mile is talking about the figma design. So the 3.1 is in progress. I will switch this in the development. So he's talking about the UI data figma. Yeah, that's why this is a 3.1 and three are the different. I can I can rename that 3.1 to different number. Okay, but these three two things are different. Sorry. Okay, I'll leave. Okay. Okay, so you need to. That's good. Just give me a session. I think. Okay, so I will rename this. I there's a problem. I will be maybe. Okay, but you are you design you need to review it. Although we have got the approval on pass, but you can review it again. We can discuss that on our next one. All right. Hello. Okay. Okay, so Ali, decide this on the additional items and from where I was, where we was, to our guide and from on additional items, these things from this additional milestone, these things are functionally implemented and being shown to you now. So you need to discuss the pricing with Muhammad. Okay, and pay for these completed items as well. All right. Okay. Okay. How many this one is ending where my stone, what seven ending? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am building this thing. Give me a second. I am building it in 74 to 90. Hold on, hold on. Do not ball that. Just undo that. Just read me read it. Okay. Okay, Ali. Is this more clear? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you need to discuss these two things. Third one about UI us, we will discuss on next one, but you know what the payment of two milestone to and the additional item which I marked on that you need to pay to Muhammad and discuss the pricing of additional item with him as well. All right. Okay. Okay. So that's I want to discuss Ali and thank you so much for your stations. Okay. Once you paid pay the second milestone and this one, I will share the complete code of these two items with you. Okay. And along with the front end of backend. Okay. Then I also I will today I will you know ask I ask Muhammad to add the add 7 to 0 page. All right. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much Ali and obviously for your patience and salam alaikum. Thank you. Assalam alaikum. Assalam alaikum. Assalam alaikum. Assalam alaikum.
